    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This holiday star bread is beautifully rich and lightly sweet, with just the right amount of dried fruit and nuts, and will be a gorgeous centerpiece for any holiday breakfast or brunch. Chef John fully demystifies the constructionâ€”you'll find it is not nearly as difficult as you expect yet so dramatic.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For dough, combine yeast, warm water, and warm milk in a stand mixer bowl, and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add sugar, egg, butter, cardamom, flour, and salt and knead with the dough hook attachment until a smooth, very soft, elastic dough forms, about 5 minutes. If dough seems too wet and sticky after a few minutes of kneading, add a little more flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed.</li>
        <li>Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and with damp hands form dough into a smooth ball. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for cinnamon sugar, whisk cinnamon and sugar together in a small bowl. For egg wash, whisk egg and melted butter together in a separate small bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, pat into a circle, and divide into 4 equal pieces. For exact portions, use a digital scale to weigh and adjust each piece.</li>
        <li>Form 1 portion of the dough into a ball, and using just enough flour to prevent sticking, roll out into about an 11-inch circle. Transfer onto a piece of parchment paper, and use your hands to pull and stretch into a uniform circle. </li>
        <li>Brush generously with egg wash nearly to the edge of the circle, then sprinkle over a rounded tablespoon of cinnamon sugar. Scatter 1/3 of cranberries, raisins, almonds, and pistachios over dough, reaching nearly to the edge. </li>
        <li>Roll the second portion of dough into another 11-inch circle, and lightly press onto the first layer of filling. Repeat layering remaining dough and filling, for 3 total layers of filling, then top with 4th dough circle.</li>
        <li>Use a 3-inch pastry cutter or a glass to mark a circle at the center of the top piece of dough. With a knife or bench scraper, cut down through all layers from the outside edge of the marked circle to the outer edge of the stack. First divide dough into 4 equal sections, and then divide each section into 4 equal sections, for 16 total sections. </li>
        <li>For each arm of the star, lift the ends of 2 sections with your fingers and twist them at least twice away from each other, then pinch the two ends together, pressing them into a point, making sure dough is well sealed.</li>
        <li>Do this for the remaining 7 sets of cut dough strips. Carefully slide parchment onto a baking sheet or pizza pan, and trim off any excess parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cover bread with a towel and let proof in a warm place until dough puffs up slightly, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Brush entire surface of bread with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. Dust with powdered sugar just before serving.</li>
